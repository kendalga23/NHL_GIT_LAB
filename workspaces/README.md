# NHL API Workspaces

The following files are meant to be imported into an application like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest), [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com), or some other REST Client.

They contain all currently documented endpoints (as of the commit of the files), as well as the documentation of each endpoints and any modifiers.

The files were created using Insomnia, and utilize Environment vars for readability.
